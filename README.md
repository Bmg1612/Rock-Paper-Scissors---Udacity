# Rock-Paper-Scissors---Udacity
This is a really simple (yet I am very proud of it) project in **python** that creates a fame of Rock Paper Scissors where you can set for a human to play against a computer player (That you can set in some cool ways).

## Requirements
You have to import the `random`library in order for this code to work.
